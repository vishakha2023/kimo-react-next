Be it the nearest hill station, or another country across the globe, most of us travel far and wide to explore. What we often forget, however, is the negative impact tourism has on the environment. While prioritising comfort and convenience, we unintentionally engage in activities that severely harm the natural world. You’d be surprised to know India has the world’s fourth-largest carbon footprint from tourism, with the USA, China, and Germany preceding it.",
